## 🧠 Project Synopsis:

### 🛑 Problem Statement:

Online exams face two major challenges:

1. **Identity Fraud** – Anyone could impersonate a student during online exams.
2. **Cheating Detection** – Participants can use external devices like phones, Bluetooth earbuds, or other wireless tools to cheat during exams.

There is no affordable and intelligent system in Ethiopia that combines identity verification and real-time cheating prevention in remote assessments.

### ✅ Implemented Solution:

**SmartGuard Exam Proctor** — an advanced online examination monitoring system that solves these challenges using:

- **Multi-Biometric Authentication** – Face, Iris, and Fingerprint recognition for secure login
- **Fayda Integration** – Post-login redirect to Fayda for additional national ID verification
- **AI Behavioral Monitoring** – Real-time webcam monitoring for suspicious activities
- **Device Detection** – Background scanning for unauthorized wireless devices
- **Real-Time Alerts** – Comprehensive dashboard for supervisors with detailed device and location info
- **Secure Exam Environment** – Prevents tab switching, copy/paste, and unauthorized access

---

### 🎯 Achieved Outcomes:

- ✅ **Professional Landing Page** - Beautiful, modern UI with smooth animations
- ✅ **Two-Step Authentication** - Credentials + Biometric verification
- ✅ **Fayda Integration** - Seamless redirect to national ID system after login
- ✅ **Advanced Exam Interface** - Professional exam environment with real-time monitoring
- ✅ **AI-Powered Monitoring** - Behavioral detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV
- ✅ **Comprehensive Dashboard** - Real-time alerts with device and location tracking
- ✅ **Production Ready** - Complete frontend and backend integration

### 🇪🇹 Fayda Integration (Updated):

Fayda integration now works as follows:

1. **User Login** - Username/password + biometric verification
2. **Fayda Redirect** - Automatic redirect to Fayda for additional verification
3. **Callback Handling** - System processes Fayda verification response
4. **Exam Access** - User proceeds to secure exam environment

This ensures:
- **Double Verification** - Both biometric and national ID verification
- **Compliance** - Meets Ethiopian government requirements
- **Security** - Multiple layers of identity verification
